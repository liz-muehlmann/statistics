# statistics
In this repo I've collected my various notes on statistics. They're from several books all listed in the header matter.

As a note, I use Atom.io to create my Rmarkdown files. This means that the code chunks in some of the files need a little adjusting before you can open and run them in Rstudio.

I tried to include the changes that need to be made in the header of the files. I've also included some information about how to set up Atom.io to run R code.
