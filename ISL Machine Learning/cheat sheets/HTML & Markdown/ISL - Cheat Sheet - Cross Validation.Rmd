*Resampling* is repeatedly draw samples from a training set and refit the model of interest on each sample to get more information.

#### Two Common Methods of Resampling
1. *Cross-Validation:* how to check your model fit
  a. Can be used for model assessment & model selection

Approach | How it works | Drawbacks
------| ------ | ---------
Validation Set | Divides observations into training and validation set fit the model on the training set | Validation test error rate can be highly variable, may over estimate the test error rate
Leave One Out Cross Validation (LOOVC) | Splits the data set into the training set and a single validation observation. | Computationally expensive, takes a lot of time if the number of observations is large.
K-fold Cross Validation (K-fold CV) | Randomly divides observations into $ k $ folds of roughly equal sizes, the first fold is the validation set, the rest are the training set, process is repeated $ k $ times. | High variance when $ k $ is less than the number of observations

For classification problems ($ Y $ is qualitative), the validation is done on how many observations are misclassified.

2. *Bootstrap:* how to check how accurate your model (or a parameter fit) is.

+ Uses the computer to emulate the process of getting new datasets.
+ Repeatedly samples observations from the original dataset
