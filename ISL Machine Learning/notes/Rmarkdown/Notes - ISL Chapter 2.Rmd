# Chapter 2

## 2.1 What is Statistical Learning?

+ $ X $ denotes the input variable (aka: predictor or independent variable)
+ $ Y $ denotes the output variable (aka: response or dependent variable)
+ The relationship between X and Y can be written as:
$ Y=f(X)+\epsilon $
+ $ f $ is a fixed, but unknown function of $ X $ and $ \epsilon $ is the error term.
+ $ \epsilon $ is independent of $ X $ and has a mean of 0.
The function $ f $ may take more than one input variable. (e.g. income ( $ y $ ) as function of education ( $ X_1 $ ) and seniority ($ X_2 $)).

Statistics is all about ways to estimate $ f $

### 2.1.1 Why Estimate $f$?
1. Prediction: this is when we know the values of $ X $, but can't easily determine $ Y $.
  + $ \hat{y} = \hat{f}(x) $
  + $ \hat{Y} $ is the resulting predicting for $ Y $ (aka the predicted response)
  + $ \hat{f} $ is the estimate for $ f $.
    + It is a *black box* - where we don't really care about $ \hat{f} $ as long as it gives accurate predictions for $ Y $.

Generally, $ \hat{f} $ will not be a perfect estimate $ f $, as a result the inaccuracy will introduce some error.

**Types of Error:**

+ *reducible error:* can be reduced to improve the accuracy of $ \hat{f} $ by using better statistical methods.
+ *irreducible error:* since $Y$ is a function of $ \epsilon $, not all of the error can be reduced. Therefore there will always be $ \epsilon $

**Reasons that $ \epsilon $ is not zero**

+ $ \epsilon $ is not zero because it might include variables that are useful in predicting $ Y $.
  + Since we don't measure these unincluded variables they can't be predicted using $ f $.
+ $ \epsilon $ may also contain unmeasurable variation, which also can't be predicted using $ f $

So if we have estimate $ \hat{f} $ and predictors $ X $ we get the prediction: $ \hat{Y} $ = $ \hat{f}(X) $.

**If we assume that $ \hat{f} $ and $ X $ are fixed:**

$$ \begin{equation}
\begin{split}
  E(Y-\hat{Y})^2 & = E[f(X) - \epsilon - \hat{f}(X)]^2\cr
      & =[f(X)-\hat{f}(X)]^2 + var(\epsilon)
\end{split}
\end{equation} $$


+ $ E=(Y-Y^2) $ is the expected value of the squared difference between the predicted value and actual value of $ Y $.
+ $ Var(\epsilon) $ is the variance associated with the error term $ \epsilon $

The irreducible error gives an upper bound on the accuracy of our prediction for $ Y $ & will almost always be unknown in practice.


2. Inference
+ *Inference* is when we want to know how $Y$ is affected by change in the predictors, $ X_1...X_p $, but aren't necessarily interested in making predictions for $ Y $.
+ the goal is to understand the relationship between $ X $ and $Y$. How $ Y $ changes as a function of $ X_1...X_p $
+ $ \hat{f} $ can't be treated as a *black box* because we have to know its exact form.
+ linear models are useful for inference.

*Inference is useful for:*

+ determining which predictors are associated with the outcome.
+ determining the relationship between the outcome and each predictor.
+ determining whether the relationship between $ Y $ and each predictor can be summarized using a linear equation or whether the relationship between the two is more complicated.

### 2.1.2 How do we Estimate $ f $?

+ $ n $ is the number of data points or observations we have.
+ *training data* is a subset of the data we have that we use to train (or teach) the method how to estimate $f$.
+ We apply a statistical learning method to the training data in order to estimate $ f $.
+ $ x_{ij} $ is the value of the $j$th predictor for observation $ i $.
$ i $ = 1, 2,..., $ n $ and $ j $ = 1, 2,...,$ p $
$ y_i $ is the response variable for $ i $th observation.
+ The training data would be $ {(x_i,y_i), (x_2, y_2),...(x_n,y_n)} $, where $ x = (x_{i1}, x_{i2},..., x_{ip})^T $.

The goal is to find $ \hat{f} $ such that $ Y \approx \hat{f}(X) $ for any observation $ (X,Y) $

**There are two statistical learning methods we can use:**

1. *Parametric:* to estimate $ f $ we only need to estimate one set of parameters.
    + the problem is that it will usually not match the true unknown form of $ f $
    + if the model is too far off from the true $ f $ (or the $ f $ using all the observations), the estimate will be poor
    + to solve poor fit, we can use more flexible models. But more flexible models requires estimating more parameters.
    + more complex models can lead to *overfitting:* which means they follow the errors too closely.
    + these involve a two-step model-based approach.


*Step 1* We make an assumption of $ f $'s form.
For example, if $ f $ is linear:

  + $ f(X) = \beta_0 + \beta_1X_1 + \beta_2X_2 + ... + \beta_pX_p $
  + If $ f $ is linear, you only need to estimate the coefficients $ \beta_0 + \beta_1X_1 + \beta_2X_2 + \beta_pX_p $

*Step 2* We use the training data to *fit* or *train* the model.
For the linear model we want to estimate: $ Y \approx \beta_0 + \beta_1X_1 + \beta_2X_2 + ... + \beta_pX_p $

One method of fitting the model is *(ordinary) least squares*

2. *Non-parametric:*

    + do not make explicit assumptions about the functional form of $ f $.
    + these methods try to get as close to the data points without being too rough.
    + since they don't assume particular form of $ f $, they can fit a wider range of shapes for $ f $.
    + will fit the data better since it does not assume the form of $ f $.
    + requires substantially more observations in order to get an accurate estimate for $f$ than parametric approaches.

### 2.1.3 The Trade-off Between Prediction Accuracy and Model Interpretability

Some methods are less flexible because they can produce only a small range of shapes to estimate $f$ (*e.g.* Linear regression can only create linear functions.)

+ less flexible models are better for inference because they are more interpretable.
+ it's easier to understand the relationship between $ Y $ and $ X_1, X_2,...X_p $
More flexible models include *thin plate splines* can generate a wider range of possible shapes to estimate $f$.

### 2.1.4 Supervised vs. Unsupervised Learning
*Supervised Learning* for each observation of the predictor measurements $ x_i, i=1,...,n $ there is an associated response to the measurement $ y_i $.

  + Includes: logistic regression, GAM, Boosting, and support vector machines

*Unsupervised Learning* is more complicated because for every observation $ i=1,...,n $ there's a vector of measurements $ x_i $, but no associated response $ y_i $.

+ it is called unsupervised because we have no response variable $ y $ to supervise our analysis.
  + Includes: cluster analysis (do the observations fall into relatively distinct groups?)

*Semi-supervised Learning* is when you have observations for the predictors, but the corresponding measurements for the responses are less available.

### 2.1.5 Regression vs. Classification Problems
*Quantitative Variables* are number variables.
  + problems involving Quantitative data are called *regression problems.*

*Qualitative Variables (aka categorical)* take on one of a number of *classes* or categories.
  + problems involving Qualitative data are called *classification* problems.

The difference between the two is not that clear cut and some methods (*K-nearest-neighbors* and *boosting*) can be used for both quantitative adn qualitative data.

Most statistical methods are based on whether the *response* is qualitative or quantitative.

## 2.2 Assessing Model Accuracy
There is no *best* method in statistical learning. The data you have determines what kind of method you can (and should!) use.

### 2.2.1 Measuring the Quality of Fit
Measuring the quality of fit is a quantification of the extent to which the predicted response value for a given observation is close to the true response value of the observation.

For regressions, the most common measure is the *mean squared error (MSE).*

  + $ MSE = \frac {1}{n} \displaystyle \sum_{i=1}^{2}(y_i - \hat{f}(x_1)^2) $
    + $ \hat{f}(x_i) $ is the prediction $ \hat{f} $ gives for the $ i $th observation.
  + a small test $ MSE $ is the goal
    + A small $ MSE $ means that the predicted responses are close to the true responses.
  + We're interested in how well our method works with previously unseen data (*i.e.,* not the training data.)
  + If we have training observations, which we use to fit obtain an estimate of $ \hat{f} $
    + $ {(x_1, y_1), (x_2, y_2), ..., (x_n, y_n)} $
  + We then compute $ \hat{f}(x_1), \hat{f}(x_2), ..., \hat{f}(x_n) $
    + If these are approximately equal to $ y_1, y_2, ..., y_n $ then the $ MSE $ is small.
  + What we want to know is if $ \hat{f}(x_0) \approx y_0 $ where $ x_0 $ and $ y_0 $ is a previously unseen test observation *not used to train the statistical learning method.* Essentially, a new data point.
    + This is the *test* $ MSE $ which is what we're interested in and the lower the better.
  + For a large number of observations we can compute:
    + $ Ave(y_0 - \hat{f}(x_0))^2 $
    + The average squared prediction error for the test observations: $ (x_0, y_0) $
    + The smaller the number the better
  + DO NOT rely on a method that results in a small *training* $ MSE $ even though the *test* and *training* $ MSE $ are closely related because most methods try to make a small training $ MSE $ which does not always result in a small *test* $ MSE $.
    + *Overfitting* Is a method that gives as small *training* $ MSE $ but a large *test* $ MSE $.
      + It means that the method may be picking up patterns that are just random chance
  + The *training* $ MSE $ will generally be smaller than the *test* $ MSE $.
  + *Cross-Validation* is a method for estimating the *test* $ MSE $ using the training data.

### 2.2.2 The Bias Variance Trade-Off
The expected *test* $ MSE $ (for a given value, $ x_0 $) is the sum of three fundamental quantities:

  1. The *variance* of $ \hat{f}(x_0) $
  2. The squared *bias* of $ \hat{f}(x_0) $
  3. The variance of the error terms $ \epsilon $.

  + this is:
    + $ E(y_0 - \hat{f}(x_0))^2 = Var(\hat{f}(x_0)) + [Bias(\hat{f}(x_))]^2 + Var(\epsilon) $
      + Where $ E(y_0 -\hat{f}(x_0)) $ is the *expected* test $ MSE $.
        + It is the average test $ MSE $ "we'd obtain if we repeatedly estimated $ f $ using a large number of training sets and tested each at $ x_0 $"
  + The test $ MSE $ will never be below $ Var(\epsilon) $ (the irreducible error)
  + Our goal is to have *low variance* and *low bias* through the *bias-variance tradeoff*
    + *Variance:* the amount that $ \hat{f} $ would change if we estimated it using a different training data set.
      + Ideally, we would not like $ \hat{f} $ to vary much between data sets.
      + a high variance would mean that small changes in the training data results in large changes in $ \hat{f} $.
      + More flexible methods will have higher variance.
    + *Bias:* is the error that is introduced by approximating real life using a simple model.
      + The closer real life is to the model used, the less bias there will be.
      + More flexible methods tend to have less bias.

### 2.2.3 The Classification Setting
This refers to problems where the outcome of interest is qualitative ( $ y_1, ... y_n $)

The most common way to quantify the accuracy of the estimate $ \hat{f} $ is training the *error rate* - which is the proportion of mistakes that are made if we apply the estimated $ \hat{f} $ to the training observations.

*Training error rate* equation is computed using the data that was used to train the classifier.

  + $ \frac {1}{n} \displaystyle \sum_{i=1}^{n}I(y_i \neq \hat{y}_i) $
    + $ \hat{y}_1 $ is the predicted class label for the $ i $th observation using $ \hat{f} $
    + $ I(y_i \neq \hat{y}_i) $ is an *indicator variable*
      + $ y_i \neq \hat{y}_i $ is coded with a 1
      + $ y_i = \hat{y}_i $ is coded with a 0
      + if $ I(y_i \neq \hat{y}_i) = 0 $ then the $ i $th observation was classified correctly by the method, otherwise it was misclassified.

We are still interested in the *test* error rate which is the error rate returned when we apply the classifier to test observations *not* used in training the data.

  + The *test error* rate is:
    + $ Ave(I(y_0 \neq \hat{y}_0)) $
      + $ \hat{y}_0 $ is the predicted class label that results from applying the classifier to the test observation with predictor $ x_0 $

  We want the test error to be the smallest - which indicates we have a good classifier.

#### The Bayes Classifier
The test error rate is minimized (on average) by a simple classifier that assigns each observation to the most likely class, given its predictor values.

  + we should assign a test observation with predictor vector $ x_0 $ to the class $ j $ for which the below is the largest
    + $ Pr(Y = j | X = x_0) $
      + This is a *conditional probability* equation.
      + It is the probability that $ Y = j $, given the observed predictor vector $ x_0 $

This is *the Bayes classifier.* In a two-class problem it says that there are only two possible response values.

  + it corresponds to predicting the first class if $ Pr(Y = 1 | X = x_0) > 0.5 $, and class two otherwise.
  + The *Bayes decision boundary* is where the points have a probability of exactly 50%.
    + The *Bayes classifier* is determined by this boundary.
  + The *Bayes classifier* produces the *Bayes error rate* which is the lowest possible test error rate.
    + The overall *Bayes Error Rate:* $ 1 - E(  m\underset{j}axPr(Y = j | X)) $
      + where the expectation averages the probability over all possible values of $ X $
      + It is analogous to the irreducible error.

Since we will never know the conditional distribution of $ Y $ given $ X $ in a real data set, the *Bayes classifier* is an unattainable gold standard against which we compare other models.

#### K-Nearest Neighbors
Attempts to estimate the conditional distribution of $ Y $ given $ X $, then classifies a given observation to the class with the highest *estimated* probability.

  + Given a positive integer $ K $ and a test observation $ x_0 $, $ KNN $:
    1. Identifies the $ K $ points in the training data that are closest to $ x_0 $ (represented by $ \mathcal{N}_0 $)
    2. Estimates the conditional probability for class $ j $ as a fraction of points in $ \mathcal{N}_0 $ whose response value equals $ j $.
    + $ Pr(y = j | x = x_0) = \frac{1}{K} \underset{i\in\mathcal{N}_0}\sum I(y_i = j) $
    3. Applies Bayes rule and classifies the test observation $ x_0 $ to the class with the largest possibility.
  + The user picks the value for $ K $.
    + A low $ K $ will produce a flexible model, but may have low bias but very high variance.
    + The higher the $ K $, the less flexible the model, which will result in low variance but high bias.
  + The *training* error and the *test* error do not have a strong relationship.
