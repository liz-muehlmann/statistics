**///////////////////////////////////////////////////////// Note: /////////////////////////////////////////////////////////**
The .Rmd file was written and compiled using the Atom.io text editor. If you download the .Rmd file and try to open it in R Studio the LaTeX equations *will not* display properly. This has a easy fix: delete the spaces between the dollar signs ($).\
Unfortunately, the R code chunks will not run properly in R Studio when downloading this .Rmd file. That is because the parameters listed inside the curly braces, {}, are incorrect. This fix is a little more time intensive, but is possible. For R studio the parameters take the form:

+ {r loaddata, attr.source='.numberLines'}

For Atom (using the Hydrogen and markdown-preview-enhanced packages), the parameters take the form:

+ r {cmd="Rscript", id="loaddata", .line-numbers}

a useful guide for using R in Atom can be found here: [R in Atom](https://jstaf.github.io/2018/03/25/atom-ide.html)

+ how to use Atom with Rmarkdown: [Rmarkdown in Atom](https://shd101wyy.github.io/markdown-preview-enhanced/#/)

why? Atom has native [Github](github.io) integration, the interface is cleaner, and you're represented by an adorable [octocat](https://myoctocat.com/).You don't need to use Atom. In this repo I've also included the PDF version of these notes. :)

*Resampling Methods* is when you repeatedly draw samples from a training set and refit the model of interest on each sample to obtain additional information about the fitted model.

  + They can be computationally expensive.

Two most common resampling methods:

1. Cross-validation\
  *Model Assessment:* Evaluating model performance\
  Can be used to estimate the test error\
  *Model Selection:* Select appropriate level of flexibility
2. Bootstrap\
  Provide a measure of accuracy of a parameter estimate or statistical model.

### 5.1 Cross-Validation
*Holding out:* keeping a subset of training observations out of the fitting process and then applying the method to those observations\
This is because we need to find the *test* error rate, but often do not have a test set available.\
Since the *training* error rate is often very different than the *test* error rate, *holding out* essentially allows us to have our cake and eat it too.

#### 5.1.1 The Validation Set Approach
**Step 1:** Randomly divide the availble set of observations into two parts:
  1. The *training set*
  2. The *validation set* or *hold-out set*

**Step 2:** Fit the model using the training set then use the predicted responses for the observations in the validation set.

+ The validation set error rate (usually using $ MSE $ for quantitative data) gives an estimate of the *test* error rate.

**Drawbacks to the validation set approach**\
1. The validation estimate of the test error rate can be highly variable.
$ \quad $ This is because it is decided by which data is included in the training vs. validation set.\
2. Since only a subset of observations are used to train the method, it may *overestimate* the test error rate.

*Cross-validation* is a refined version of the validation set approach & addresses these two issues.

#### 5.1.2 Leave-One-Out-Cross-Validation (LOOCV)
This approach also splits the data into two parts, but a single observation is used for validation $ (x_1, x_0) $ while the rest is used to make up the training set $ (x_2, y_2, ..., x_n, y_n).$\

+ LOOCV is a general method that can be used with any kind of predictive modeling.
+ The model is then fit on the training set  $ (n-1) $.
+ Prediction $ (\hat{y}_1) $ is made for the excluded observation using its value $ x_1 $.
+ Since $ (x_1, y_1) $ wasn't used in the fitting process, $ MSE_1 = (y_1 - \hat{y}_2) $ is an approximately unbiased estimate for the test error.
+ It is highly variable, though, since it's based on a single observation.
  + To combat the variablity, the process is run multiple times. The result of the LOOCV estimate for the test MSE is the average of these $ n $ test error estimates:
$ \quad $ $CV_{(n)} = \frac{1}{n} \displaystyle \sum_{i=1}^{n}MSE_i $


**Advantages to LOOCV**
1. It has less bias.
2. Performing LOOCV multiple times will always result in the same results because there is no randomness in the training/validation set splits.

**Potential Downsides**
1. It might be computationally expensive, since it fits each point.
2. It might take awhile if $ n $ is large.

This is easy to vercome when using least squares or polynomial regression:\
$ CV_{(n)} = \frac{1}{n} \displaystyle \sum_{i=1}^{n} \bigg(\frac{y_i - \hat{y}_i}{1-h_i}\bigg)^2 $

  + $ \hat{y}_i $ is the $ i $th fitted value from the original least squares fit
  + $ h_i $ is the leverage

The equation holds because the leverage lies between $ 1/n $ and 1 and reflects the amount an observation influences its own fit.
Thus, the residuals for high-leverage points are inflated the right amount for the equality to hold.

#### 5.1.3 k-Fold Cross-Validation (k-fold CV)
This approach randomly divides a set of observations into $ k $ groups (aka *folds*) of roughly equal size.
The first fold is treated as a validation set. The method is then fit on the remaining $ k-1 $ folds. The $ MSE_1 $ is computed on the observations in the validation set.
The process is repeated $ k $ times with a different set held out as the validation set.
Since the process is repeated $ k $ number of times, the *k-fold CV* estimate is the average of those values:

  + $CV_(k) = \frac{1}{k} \displaystyle \sum_{i=1}^{k}MSE_i $

*k-fold CV* is usually only used when $ k = 5 $ and $ k = 10 $ rather than $ k = n $ as is done for $ LOOCV $
As a result, *k-fold CV* is less computationally expensive. Since it is a general method it can be applied to most statistical learning methods.

#### 5.1.4 Bias-Variance Trade-Off for k-fold Cross-Validation
*k-fold CV* often gives a more accurate estimate of the test error rate than *LOOCV*

  + *LOOCV* will result in less bias since it is using $ n-1 $ observations (nearly the same amount as total observations.)
  + *k-fold CV* will result in intermediate bias since the training set contains $ (k-1)n/k $ observations (more than *LOOCV* but less than the validation set approach)
  + But, *LOOCV* has a higher variance than *k-fold CV* does when $ k < n $
    + This is because the outputs of *LOOCV* are highly positively correlated with each other since each model is trained on almost identical data.
    + In contrast, *k-fold CV* averages the outputs of the fitted models and are thus less correlated with each other since the overlap between training sets is smaller.

#### 5.1.5 Cross-Validation on Classification Problems
For problems when $ Y $ is qualitative, instead of using the $ MSE $ to quantify test error we use the number of misclassified observations.
*LOOCV* for qualitative problems:

  + $ CV_n = \frac{1}{n} \displaystyle \sum_{i=1}^{n}Err_i $
    + where $ Err_i = I(y_i \neq \hat{y}_i) $

*k-fold CV* and *validation set* approaches remain the same.

### 5.2 The Bootstrap
*Bootstrap* is a tool that can be used to "quantify the uncertainty associated with a given estimator or statistical learning method."

  + It can be used to estimate standard errors of the coefficients in linear regression fits.
    + R does this automatically, but *bootstrap* can be used for other methods which are harder to obtain estimates for.
  + It uses the computer to emulate the process of getting new datasets so we can estimate variability without generating more samples.
  + It obtains distinct data sets by repeatedly sampling observations from the original dataset.

$ SE_B(\hat{\alpha}) = \sqrt{\frac{1}{B-1} \displaystyle \sum_{r-1}^{B} \bigg( \hat{\alpha}^{*r} - \frac{1}{B} \displaystyle \sum_{r'=1}^{B}\hat{\alpha}^{*r'} \bigg)} $

  + this equation computes the standard error of the bootstrap estimates.
