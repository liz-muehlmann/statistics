## You'll have to load the libraries library("ISLR") and library("MASS"). The latter package needs to be installed first using install.packages("MASS"). You only need to install the package once.

## load libraries
library("MASS")
library("ISLR")

## load data
## since we're using data stored in an R package and not a CSV, you need to store the data in a variable to call on later
print("College")
