## Chapter 3: Linear Regression
### conceptual

<span style = "color: grey">
1. Describe the null hypotheses to which the p-values given in Table 3.4 correspond. Explain what conclusions you can draw based on these p-values. Your explanation should be phrased in terms of sales, TV, radio, and newspaper, rather than in terms of the coefficients of the linear model.

| TV | Null Hypothesis |
| ------------- | ------------- |
TV | $H_0 = \beta_0 = 0$
radio | $H_0 = \beta_1 = 0$
newspaper | $H_0 = \beta_2 = 0$
<br>
The p-values for TV and Radio are significant, so the null hypothesis can be rejected. The p-value for newspapers is higher than the accepted significance level of p < 0.05 and cannot be rejected. This indicates that newspaper advertising does not increase sales when there is also TV and Radio advertising.
